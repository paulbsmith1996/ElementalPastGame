Bugs To Fix:

Overworld:
1) Holding down a key that is not directional causes player to stop moving
2) Laggy movement, most likely due to fact that it takes 20-70 ms to actually render the background
3) Player cannot walk over collidable entities, but collidable entities can walk over player
4) Can't change orientation to talk to an NPC

Battle:
1) When the move resolution info display pops up for the enemy, it is occasionally "laggy" and doesn't get the first few key taps for some reason
2) Enemies do not have any move selection programmed yet, therefore they think they are using the same move as the previous allied entity battle model.

Infrastructure:
1) Multiple sources of truth for an entity's location. Gotta fix that in the active entity manager.
2) Basically impossible to separate out key input subscribers and things that want to draw. These need to be separated out.
	Look at every instance of HandleKeysDown, there's probably some rendering model updates in there
	Key subscribers should be a stack, not a list, there should never be a scenario where multiple objects need to get the same key input. I just need to push and pop the active key listener when needed
3) Interaction textboxes are rendering behind the over world, and so are invisible
