Bugs To Fix:

Overworld:
1) Holding down a key that is not directional causes player to stop moving
2) Laggy movement, most likely due to fact that it takes 20-70 ms to actually render the background

Battle:
1) Kill top enemy, escape battle, re-enter battle and dead enemy is selected (seek to first alive enemy on battle start)
