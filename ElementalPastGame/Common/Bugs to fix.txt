Bugs To Fix:

Overworld:
1) Holding down a key that is not directional causes player to stop moving
2) Laggy movement, most likely due to fact that it takes 20-70 ms to actually render the background

Battle:
1) Kill top enemy, escape battle, re-enter battle and dead enemy is selected (seek to first alive enemy on battle start) FIXED
2) When the move resolution info display pops up for the enemy, it is occasionally "laggy" and doesn't get the first few key taps for some reason
