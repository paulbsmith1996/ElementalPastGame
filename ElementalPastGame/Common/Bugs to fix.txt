Bugs To Fix:

Overworld:
1) Holding down a key that is not directional causes player to stop moving
2) Laggy movement, most likely due to fact that it takes 20-70 ms to actually render the background

Battle:
1) When the move resolution info display pops up for the enemy, it is occasionally "laggy" and doesn't get the first few key taps for some reason
2) Enemies do not have any move selection programmed yet, therefore they think they are using the same move as the previous allied entity battle model.

Infrastructure:
1) Multiple sources of truth for an entity's location. Gotta fix that in the active entity manager.
